# 📊 Empirical Industrial Organisation

This repository gathers key applied projects completed during my Master's in Economic Analysis (CY Cergy Paris Université & ESSEC Business School), in the course *Empirical Industiral Organisation*. I obtained a final grade of **19/20** for this course.

These projects simulate real market dynamics, estimate demand systems, and evaluate public policy or competition scenarios, combining **theoretical grounding**, **empirical rigor**, and **data-driven simulations**.

## 🧠 Why these projects matter

> In an era of rising market concentration and digital transformation, understanding how firms set prices, how consumers respond, and how welfare evolves is crucial. These projects show how empirical IO tools can inform regulation, merger analysis, and policy design.

Through these notebooks, I:

- Estimate price elasticities, marginal costs and markups  
- Simulate the effects of mergers or taxes on competition and welfare  
- Model imperfect competition (Bertrand, Cournot)  
- Translate firm-level and market-level assumptions into **quantifiable policy outcomes**

## 📂 Notebooks

### `📌 take-home-exam-FARES-DJAMILA.ipynb`

Final take-home exam (graded 19/20).  
It simulates a competitive market and analyzes the welfare effects of a price increase by one firm:

- Computes elasticities, marginal costs, consumer surplus
- Simulates price shifts and resulting profit/surplus changes
- Provides both quantitative results and economic interpretation
- Includes visualisation and commentary

### `📌 Exercices_3.ipynb`

Applied exercise on **logit demand estimation and markup computation**:

- Builds a logit model to estimate consumer preferences
- Calculates price elasticities and pass-through effects
- Explores equilibrium effects of price changes under competition
- Includes plots and markdown-based interpretations

### `📌 EIO_HM3_Djamila_Fares.ipynb`

Home assignment focused on **merger simulation** and **firm strategy**:

- Models Cournot competition and simulates a merger
- Analyzes equilibrium prices, quantities, and welfare shifts
- Includes strategic insights into consumer surplus and firm incentives

### `📌 EIO_Exercices_Djamila_Fares.ipynb`

Series of shorter exercises to test and implement:

- Lerner Index, markup formulas, profit maximization  
- Demand curve shapes under different assumptions  
- Effects of fixed vs marginal cost variation

## 📝 Written Assignments (HM1, HM2, HM3)

These documents are **written responses to structured economic questions**, each focusing on a specific empirical IO topic:

- `EIO_HM1_Djamila_Fares.pdf` — Written argument addressing firm pricing power
- `EIO_HM2_Djamila_Fares.pdf` — Simulation and interpretation of competitive outcomes
- `EIO_HM3_Djamila_Fares.pdf` — Theoretical and empirical analysis of a merger scenario

Each written piece tackles a real-world-style question and applies **economic reasoning, theoretical models, and empirical justification**.

## 🧰 Tools and methods

These projects were developed using:

- **Python** in Jupyter Notebooks
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`
- Economic models: logit, Bertrand/Cournot competition, demand simulation
- Rigorously interpreted results with markdown commentary

## 🎓 What this shows

✅ My ability to operationalize economic models  
✅ My fluency in **data science tools** applied to market problems  
✅ My capacity to combine **code, economics, and policy insight**  
✅ My rigor and autonomy: all projects are clean, reproducible, and fully documented
